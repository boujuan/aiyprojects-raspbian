This code is uses snowboy to create a local hotword detector for the AIY Voice Kit api version 2. Also allows voice activation. You can demo the system by using the snowboy.umdl file and "snowboy" as the hotword. Otherwise you need to get an account with snowboy to create your own hotword file. Use recordKeyword to create this file. To run snowboy you may need to install libatlas, but other than that you don't need to install the other snowboy prerequisites such as pyaudio and sox as this is using the voice hat for the recording

sudo apt-get install libatlas-base-dev

Everything here is using Python 3 so run the /home/pi/bin/AIY-voice-kit-shell.sh which should set this up for you. I have made available all the snowboy files which work with Python 3 as they aren't available on the snowboy site and there doesn't seem to be a correct version of Swig to compile for the pi. But this all works on my machine as they say. If I've missed something then let me know. The easiest way is to copy all these files and the resources folder into the src folder.
